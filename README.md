Swift - Kitty Cat Meow Demo App

App created in Xcode 10 (10A255) using Swift and tested on a iPhone X Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Meow Kitty Cat App' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with kitty background graphic and a large kitty cat graphic at the bottom graphic.
The user then clicks the button and a label is displayed (1.5 sec.) on top with the "Meow!!!" text show.
Along with the text a Meow Cat sound is heard. Then the label is hidden again.
Each time the user clicks the button the label is displayed and the sound is played.

Coming soon:
